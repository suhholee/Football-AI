# Football-AI
This is a football tracking computer vision project I worked on using Roboflow, YoloV8, and supervision.

I referenced Roboflow's Football AI tutorial to build my own trained model with pre-processed data, use inference with supervision, and clustered the players into separate teams.

This is an on-going project and information will be updated on my README, so stay tuned!
